# Plan: Edit Hero Image Laptop Screen

## What We'll Do

Edit the hero image to show a Figma-like design interface on the MacBook screen, reinforcing the web design services you offer.

## Technical Approach

1. **Use AI Image Editing**
   - Take the current hero image (`src/assets/hero-office.jpg`)
   - Use the Lovable AI image generation API to edit the laptop screen
   - Prompt the AI to add a clean Figma-style design interface showing wireframes/mockups
   - Keep the same rustic, minimalist aesthetic with earthy tones

2. **Replace the Image**
   - Save the edited image back to `src/assets/hero-office.jpg`
   - No code changes needed since `HeroSection.tsx` already imports this image

## Expected Result

The laptop screen will display a professional design tool interface (Figma-style) with website wireframes or mockups, making it clear that Lógica Analógica is a web design company - while maintaining the calm, natural atmosphere of the original image.
